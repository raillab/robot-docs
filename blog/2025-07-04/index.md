🚀 Welcome to the official documentation hub for the RAIL Lab Robots!

We're excited to launch this site as a **one-stop resource** for everything happening across our robotic platforms and research projects. Whether you're a fellow researcher or curious collaborator, this site is designed to give you **easy access to knowledge, tools, and updates** from across the lab.

## 🤖 What You'll Find Here

This documentation site is structured around our core robotic platforms and projects. Here’s what you can explore:

- **📂 Robot Setup Guides:** Step-by-step instructions for getting started with platforms like the A1 Quadruped, TurtleBot2, Husky UGV, BlueROV2, and more.
- **🧠 Project Overviews:** Descriptions of our ongoing research — from autonomous navigation to multi-agent coordination and reinforcement learning.
- **⚙️ Code & API References:** Links to GitHub repositories, ROS packages, and software stacks that power our robots.
- **📚 Tutorials & How-Tos:** Bite-sized guides for using sensors, debugging hardware, deploying models, and more.
- **📝 Internal Notes & FAQs:** Common gotchas, lab-specific hardware quirks, and practical advice from those who’ve been in the trenches.

## 💡 Why This Site Exists

We believe documentation should be:

- 🪄 **Clear and beginner-friendly**, without sacrificing depth.
- 🤝 **Collaborative**, so anyone in the lab can contribute and improve it.
- 🔄 **Versioned**, so each project and robot can evolve safely and transparently.
- 🌍 **Open (when appropriate)**, to foster learning and collaboration with the broader robotics and research community.

#### 🛠 Built With Love (and Docusaurus)

This site is powered by [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), an open-source documentation framework. We've tailored it to suit our lab's needs, but it's always evolving — just like our robots.
